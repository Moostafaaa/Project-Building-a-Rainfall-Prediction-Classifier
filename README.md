# Project-Building-a-Rainfall-Prediction-Classifier
## IBM Machine Learning Final Project: Building a Rainfall Prediction Classifier
### Objectives
- Explore and perform feature engineering on a real-world data set
- Build a classifier pipeline and optimize it using grid search cross validation
- Evaluate your model by interpreting various performance metrics and visualizations
- Implement a different classifier by updating your pipeline
- Use an appropriate set of parameters to search over in each case Instruction(s)
